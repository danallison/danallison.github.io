        <br/>
        <div><strong>Q: Who are you?</strong></div>
        <div>A: My name is Dan Allison. I live in Seattle with my family.</div>
        <hr/>
        <div><strong>Q: How do I contact you?</strong></div>
        <div>A: My email is <a href="mailto:dan@calculist.io">dan@calculist.io</a>. You can also DM me on Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/danallison">@danallison</a>.</div>
        <hr/>
        <div><strong>Q: What do you do?</strong></div>
        <div>
          A: I mostly build software and draw. My hobbies include meditation, juggling, math, and learning whatever I happen to be curious about at the moment.
        </div>
        <hr/>
        <div><strong>Q: What's your background?</strong></div>
        <div>A: Professionally, I've bounced around a bit. In college, I first studied <strong>music</strong> at Naropa University in Boulder, Colorado while also working a part-time job doing <strong>video production</strong> for a non-profit.
          <br/><br/>
          Then I dropped out of college, hitchhiked around the country for a while, and eventually moved to Chicago where I took a bunch of <strong>comedy improv</strong> classes before getting into <strong>animation</strong> through Flashpoint Academy (now part of Columbia College). I worked in animation for a while making educational videos for a large corporation.
          <br/><br/>
          Then I went to a <strong>software development</strong> bootcamp, moved to Seattle, and started working as a Ruby on Rails and JavaScript developer at a startup. On nights and weekends, I studied <strong>mathematics</strong> online through Southern New Hampshire University for a while, then took a break from my day job to attend a <strong>data science</strong> bootcamp.
          <br/><br/>
          Today, I work as the <strong>founder</strong> of <a href="https://calculist.io">Calculist</a>.

        <div><strong>Q: If you were stuck on a desert island with only one book, what would it be?</strong></div>
        <div>A: It's a toss up between the <i>Tao Te Ching</i> and <i>The Complete Calvin and Hobbes</i> (which is technically multiple books, but c'mon, you gotta have the complete set).</div>
