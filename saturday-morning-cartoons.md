# Saturday Morning Cartoons

__Saturday Morning Cartoons__ is a weekly online event (and sometimes hybrid local + online) on the [Tetra Global](https://tetracity.net/global) discord server at 11AM Seattle time where friends can hang out and draw together. At the end of the hour, everyone is invited to share whatever they'd like to share.
