<h1>Braindumps</h1>
<p>
  These are my braindumps that I try to write everyday. No promises on quality or even coherence. I just want to be in the habit of publishing something everyday regardless of quality so that I can have a public record of my thought process over time, and also to have some raw material to use for more polished writings.
</p>

{% assign pages = site.pages | reverse %}
{% assign current_month = "" %}
<ul>
{% for page in pages %}
  {% if page.path contains 'braindump-' %}
    {% assign date = page.name | slice: 10, 20 %}
    {% assign file_month = date | slice: 0, 7 %}
    {% if file_month != current_month %}
      {% assign current_month = file_month %}
      </ul>
      <h2 id="{{ current_month }}">{{ current_month }}</h2>
      <ul>
    {% endif %}
        <li>
          <a href="{{ page.permalink }}">
