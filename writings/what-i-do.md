# What I Do

_Last updated April 2, 2025_

I'm writing this so that I can have something to point people to that explains what I do.

My professional work revolves mostly around group coordination. I run [Ibis Coordination](https://ibis-coordination.com) and help people solve group coordination problems. My work with group coordination is heavily influenced by my experience with comedy improv and with systems engineering (software & data). As part of this work, I also build the open-source app [Harmonic Team](https://harmonic.team).

In addition to group coordination stuff, I also [draw](/drawings). When I was a kid I loved Calvin and Hobbes and The Far Side and I wanted to be a cartoonist when I grew up, and I later got my degree in animation and worked professionally as an animator for a while. But at some point I became a software engineer and now drawing is my hobby, which is honestly kinda nice because I can just draw whatever I want and not have to worry about meeting other people's expectations.

I'm also into meditation and metacognition, influenced by teachers like Shinzen Young and Rob Burbea.
