# Collective-player Games

_Last updated April 5, 2025_

__This page is work in progress. More explanation will be added eventually.__

## Definition

Collective-player games are games in which individual "players" are collectively controlled.

## Collective-player â‰  Multiplayer

The concept of collective-player games is different than the concept of multiplayer games. Collective-player games can be either multiplayer or single-player.

The categorization of a game as either multiplayer or single-player depends on how many players there are from the internal perspective of the game (i.e. the perspective from within the game), but the categorization of the game as collective-player or not collective-player depends on how many individuals in the external context map to a single player in the internal context. Games that map external to internal players one-to-one are not collective-player, while games that map external to internal players many-to-one are collective-player.

## Example

The most popular example of a collective-player game is the Ouija board in which two or more people use their hands to control a single object that acts as the "player" that chooses letters on the board to spell out messages.
