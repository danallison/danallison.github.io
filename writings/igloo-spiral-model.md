# The Igloo Spiral Model of Group Coordination

_Last updated April 5, 2025_

__This page is work in progress. More explanation will be added eventually.__

Igloos are built one snow brick at a time in a continuous spiral where each brick is supported by the previous bricks, forming a self-supporting dome structure. Group coordination can be modeled as a similar pattern.

The rotational motion represents the group’s movement through its operational cycle (i.e. OODA loop). The vertical motion represents the group’s increasing operational competence. And the inward motion represents the group’s increasing support that it provides to its members.

As the group gains experience (rotational motion), it becomes more skilled (vertical motion) and better able to support its members (inward motion). The more skillfully the group supports its members, the faster the group can move through its operational cycle and gain even more experience.
