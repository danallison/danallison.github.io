## Definition

Acceptance voting is a voting method similar to approval voting that features a distinction between acceptance and preference.

For each option, voters indicate first whether they would accept the option and second whether they prefer the option. The winning option is the one with the greatest acceptance, and if there is a tie then the winning option is the one with the greatest preference.

## Individual vs Group Decision-making

The fundamental difference between decision-making as an individual and decision-making as a group comes down to the necessity of negotiation.

As an individual making an individual decision, no negotiation is needed. You simply choose the option you most prefer. There is no need to make any distinction between preference and acceptance. From an individual perspective, “preference” and “acceptance” are essentially synonyms.

As an individual participating in a group decision, negotiation is necessary. You must make tradeoffs in order to find mutual agreement between everyone in the group. The option that you most prefer might not be preferred by others in the group. Now the distinction between preference and acceptance becomes relevant, and acceptance is the more important of the two.

In group decision-making, the primary goal is to find an option that everyone is willing to accept, even if that option is not what you prefer.

## The Problem with Approval Voting

One common criticism of approval voting is that it is confusing to voters. What exactly does “approval” mean? It’s not as obvious as advocates of approval voting often assume.

The answer that acceptance voting posits is that the concept of approval is a conflation of acceptance and preference, and it is better to separate those concepts explicitly.
