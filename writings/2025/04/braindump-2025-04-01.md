## Braindump, Tuesday 2025-04-01

I'm going to write more work-in-progress style notes to stay in the habit of writing and publishing on a regular basis. What I write here may or may not be of interest to anyone but me. This is just a public journal basically to try and lower the bar so I can just get into the habit of writing more.

Some topics on my mind lately:

* Elinor Ostrom, governance of the commons
* Health stuff
* Relating to AI as a user, software developer, artist, parent, human
* Acceptance voting, writing formal academic paper
* Comedy and cognitive dissonance, the social function of jester's privilege
* Collective-player games, improv, collective providence
* Neutral empathy, shared goal convergence
