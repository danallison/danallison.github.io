## Braindump, Thursday 2025-04-03

I updated the website for [collectiveprovidence.church](https://collectiveprovidence.church) today. I want to maybe do more research and talk to people about this idea. I want to clarify the vision, help people see what's possible, but also give people a roadmap and set expectation and protect against all the ways that intentional communities can fail.

* What does the process look like?
* What are the benefits and the costs?
* What are the risks?
* How would it be organized?
* How would leadership work? group decision-making?
