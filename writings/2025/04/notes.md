# April, 2025 Notes

Dear reader, these notes are mainly intended for my own use, but they are publicly available so that I can stay in the habit of sharing my writing publicly and keep a public record of my thoughts and things.

## Wednesday, 4/2

I'm planning to comb through my old twitter threads to try and extract writing that I can publish as standalone pieces in my [writings](/writings). I'm also in the process of adding all my daily drawings that are posted on twitter to [drawings](/drawings). There are hundreds of drawings, so this is going to take a while. So far I've gotten back through last November. I'm going to try to add a month's worth of drawings per day so I should be caught up in a couple weeks.

Generally, I'm trying to take the content I've been posting on twitter and add it to my own website for safekeeping and easier navigation. But there's a backlog that I need to comb through.

...

Maybe I should write up some book reviews/recommendations.

## Tuesday, 4/1

I'm going to write more work-in-progress style notes to stay in the habit of writing and publishing on a regular basis. What I write here may or may not be of interest to anyone but me. This is just a public journal basically to try and lower the bar so I can just get into the habit of writing more.

Some topics on my mind lately:

* Elinor Ostrom, governance of the commons
* Health stuff
* Relating to AI as a user, software developer, artist, parent, human
* Acceptance voting, writing formal academic paper
* Comedy and cognitive dissonance, the social function of jester's privilege
* Collective-player games, improv, collective providence
* Neutral empathy, shared goal convergence
