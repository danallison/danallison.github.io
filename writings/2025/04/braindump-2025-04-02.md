# Braindump, Wednesday 2025-04-02

I'm planning to comb through my old twitter threads to try and extract writing that I can publish as standalone pieces in my [writings](/writings). I'm also in the process of adding all my daily drawings that are posted on twitter to [drawings](/drawings). There are hundreds of drawings, so this is going to take a while. So far I've gotten back through last November. I'm going to try to add a month's worth of drawings per day so I should be caught up in a couple weeks.

Generally, I'm trying to take the content I've been posting on twitter and add it to my own website for safekeeping and easier navigation. But there's a backlog that I need to comb through.

...

Maybe I should write up some book reviews/recommendations.

### Things I want to write about

* "Yes, and" as reciprocal leadership
* Simple guards against sociopaths
* Randomness and fairness
* Good fences make good neighbors
* Collective-player games
* The Church of Collective Providence
* Egrecho
* Games Not Cults
