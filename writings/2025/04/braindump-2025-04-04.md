# Braindump, Friday 2025-04-04

Things I either am writing about or plan to write about:

* Acceptance voting (writing a formal paper on this)
* Collective-player games
* The collective-player decision sequence protocol
* Why comedy improv is the simplest example of a functioning group mind
* Why comedy facilitates group cohesion
* How improv is a symmetrical leadership structure where everyone is both a leader and follower
* Why I'm starting [the Church of Collective Providence](https://collectiveprovidence.church)
* [Coordination Camp](https://coordination.camp)

There are things I'm forgetting. I think maybe I'm overthinking. I have too many open loops in my head right now.
